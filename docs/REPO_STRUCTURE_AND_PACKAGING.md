# Repo Structure And Packaging

## Purpose

This document defines the structural rules for the Warcraft monorepo.

It exists to keep future changes aligned with the intended architecture:
- separate service CLIs
- shared libraries with clear boundaries
- a thin `warcraft` wrapper
- isolated service packages
- purpose-driven exceptions instead of accidental coupling

## Core Decisions

### Monorepo Shape

This should be a monorepo with multiple package-level projects.

Each service package should be buildable from:
- its own source
- shared source

It should not depend on other service packages just because they live in the same repo.

### Install Model

Support both:
- one umbrella install for normal users
- service-specific installs for focused users or development workflows

That means:
- `warcraft` should be the umbrella package
- `wowhead`, `method`, `icy-veins`, `raiderio`, `simc`, `raidbots`, and `warcraftlogs` should also be independently installable

### Wrapper Model

`warcraft` is a routing and orchestration layer.

It should:
- proxy to service CLIs
- offer shared search and resolve
- offer shared environment diagnostics

It should not:
- own service parsers
- own API schemas
- own SimC execution logic
- become a second implementation layer for every service

### Backward Compatibility

The current `wowhead` release should be tagged before the migration starts.

After that:
- the old implementation does not need to remain frozen internally
- the end state does need to reach at least feature parity for `wowhead`

## Language Policy

### Default Language

Python is the default language for this monorepo.

Reasons:
- existing codebase is already Python
- Python is a strong fit for HTML extraction, HTTP clients, CLI work, local tooling orchestration, and file-backed data workflows
- the wrapper and shared layers benefit more from iteration speed and maintainability than from raw runtime performance

For now, the intended baseline is:
- shared libraries: Python
- wrapper: Python
- all services: Python

## Package Boundaries

### Shared Packages

These are the first shared package targets:

- `warcraft-core`
  - output shaping
  - field projection
  - structured errors
  - config loading
  - environment inspection helpers
- `warcraft-api`
  - HTTP client primitives
  - retries and backoff
  - throttling hooks
  - auth/config persistence helpers
- `warcraft-content`
  - bundle storage
  - index management
  - freshness tracking
  - local query scaffolding

These shared packages should stay narrow and infrastructure-focused.

### Service Packages

Each service package owns:
- parsing rules
- API contracts
- service-specific identifiers
- service-specific ranking behavior
- service-specific operational constraints

Examples:
- `wowhead` owns Wowhead entity/page parsing
- `method` owns Method guide parsing
- `raiderio` owns Raider.IO endpoint and profile logic
- `simc` owns local repo/build/run orchestration
- `warcraftlogs` owns GraphQL query catalogs and auth scope handling

### Dependency Direction

Allowed:
- service package -> shared package
- umbrella package -> shared package
- umbrella package -> service CLI invocation

Not allowed:
- service package -> another service package
- shared package -> service package

## Auth Policy

Auth is not required for the initial implementation phase, but the structure should be planned now.

Preferred order:
- OS keychain when available
- file-based secret storage with strict permissions as fallback
- env vars for CI and headless usage

Rules:
- store secrets per service
- keep shared config separate from secrets
- do not write secrets into bundles, manifests, or shared cache entries
- let each service own its own auth logic even if storage helpers are shared

## Search Policy

`warcraft search` should query all services available to the user.

That includes:
- unauthenticated services by default
- authenticated services when the user has configured auth for them

This means provider discovery must be auth-aware and capability-aware.

## Storage Policy

Use one common root with service-specific subdirectories and a separate shared directory.

High-level shape:
- `shared/`
- `wowhead/`
- `method/`
- `icy-veins/`
- `raiderio/`
- `simc/`
- `raidbots/`
- `warcraftlogs/`

Use the shared directory only for data that is actually shared. Do not use it as a dumping ground.

## Platform Policy

Plan Linux first.

Cross-platform support can come later, but the structure should avoid making Linux-first assumptions impossible to revisit.

`simc` is the biggest reason this needs to be explicit.

## Release Policy

Use one release pipeline for the monorepo for now.

That does not require one combined CLI. It only means release management stays centralized until there is a reason to split it.

## Recommended Initial Layout

A good initial target is:

- `packages/warcraft-core/`
- `packages/warcraft-api/`
- `packages/warcraft-content/`
- `packages/warcraft-cli/`
- `packages/wowhead-cli/`
- `packages/method-cli/`
- `packages/icy-veins-cli/`
- `packages/raiderio-cli/`
- `packages/simc-cli/`
- `packages/raidbots-cli/`
- `packages/warcraftlogs-cli/`
- `skills/warcraft/`

Service-specific root skills can be added later if they prove useful. For now, the root `warcraft` skill should use progressive disclosure and route agents to the right service plan and CLI.
