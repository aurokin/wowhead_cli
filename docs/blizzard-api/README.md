# Blizzard API CLI

## Why Add It

`blizzard-api` should exist because it gives us the canonical official source for supported World of Warcraft game data and profile data.

That matters because:
- some lookups should prefer the authoritative source before community mirrors
- this provider will force us to validate OAuth, region handling, namespace handling, and official-source routing in the monorepo

## Research Summary

Current official signals:
- Blizzard directs developers to the Battle.net developer portal for API documentation and auth flows
- World of Warcraft support includes both Game Data and Profile API families
- OAuth is a first-class requirement, including server-to-server authentication flows
- the API ecosystem is region- and namespace-aware, which makes it structurally different from guide and ranking sites

## Access Model

This should be treated as an official authenticated API service:
- authenticate with OAuth
- call documented Game Data and Profile endpoints
- model region and namespace explicitly
- cache within policy and respect the official access model

Shared auth direction for this provider is defined in [AUTH_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md](/home/auro/code/warcraft_cli/docs/architecture/AUTH_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md). `blizzard-api` should be the second validation point for the shared OAuth-oriented auth architecture after `warcraftlogs`.

## Likely CLI Shape

- `blizzard-api doctor`
- `blizzard-api search "<query>"`
- `blizzard-api resolve "<query>"`
- `blizzard-api item <id-or-name>`
- `blizzard-api spell <id-or-name>`
- `blizzard-api character <realm> <name>`
- `blizzard-api realm <slug>`
- `blizzard-api connected-realm <id>`
- `blizzard-api auction-house <connected-realm-id>`

The first useful slice should stay narrower than that:
- `doctor`
- auth verification
- one game-data lookup
- one profile lookup

## What Can Reuse Shared Code

- shared HTTP infrastructure
- cache and TTL infrastructure
- shared output shaping
- wrapper provider contract
- future shared auth/config primitives once those are proven

## What Should Stay Service-Specific

- OAuth token handling
- region and namespace rules
- endpoint models and query builders
- official API error normalization

Recommended auth posture:
- reuse shared credential discovery
- reuse shared token/state persistence helpers once implemented
- keep Battle.net OAuth, scopes, and namespace/region behavior provider-local

## What This Service Should Validate

- auth/config patterns for official APIs
- region and namespace handling in shared infrastructure
- when the wrapper should prefer official Blizzard data over community sources

## Risks

- auth and namespace complexity is materially higher than our current providers
- some natural-language searches may not map cleanly to official endpoints without local lookup assistance
- official API policy constraints should drive cache behavior, not the other way around
